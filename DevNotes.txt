Coles Notes:

(gameplay)

Double jump on mid air needs to be fixed / deactivated (realistic gravity laws)

Time cooldown before can sling next swing-web, which will fix multiple bugs when swinging too early after releasing

Stronger web boost when swinging (potential upgrade system options further down the line / not priority at this stage)

(anims)

Landing/Idle needs to be more Spider-Man like. (new amim)
Diving pose after so long in standard fall pose. (pre-made anim, apply by chance/countdown)
